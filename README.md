This [website](http://tlarson07.github.io/) hasn't been updated since 2016... sorry. It was created after my first coding class in high school. Why? Because the one I made it class was bad and that was bugging me. I think this is better. 

## Lessons
- Practice working with 'programming languages'(HTML, CSS)
- Basic git features 
- Problem solving UI bugs
- Creating vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator 
- Custimizing text editor (live HTML preview - atom)

## Future

You might be asking yourself if this will ever get a fresh coat of paint or some new content, probably not, but I won't say no.
